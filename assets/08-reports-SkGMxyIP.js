const e="## Adding a summary report endpoint\n\nYou can add a `?action=report&type=summary` query to `doGet` and compute totals:\n\n- `totalProducts` — number of product rows\n- `totalStockValue` — sum(quantity * costPrice)\n- `totalSales` — sum of sales totals\n- `totalPurchases` — sum of purchase totals\n- `topSellingProducts` — aggregate sales by productId\n- `lowStockItems` — products where `quantity <= lowStockThreshold`\n\n### Example stub (to add into the main code)\n\n```javascript\nfunction generateSummaryReport() {\n  // read Products, Sales, Purchases sheets, aggregate values and return report object\n}\n```\n\nCall it from `doGet` when `e.parameter.action === 'report'` and `e.parameter.type === 'summary'`.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n*End of multi-file guide.*\n\nIf you want, I can now:\n\n- Export each section as separate `.md` files and provide them in a zip.\n- Add an `API key` check to the code.\n- Implement the `generateSummaryReport()` function and wire a `/report` query.\n\nTell me which of the above you'd like next.";export{e as default};
