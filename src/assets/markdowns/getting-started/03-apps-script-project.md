## 1) Open Apps Script

1. With your spreadsheet open, go to `Extensions` → `Apps Script`.
2. A new Apps Script project will open (linked to this spreadsheet). If you prefer a standalone script, create it from script.google.com and use `SpreadsheetApp.openById(SPREADSHEET_ID)`.

## 2) Add the code

1. In the Apps Script editor replace the default `Code.gs` content with the full code from `05-full-code.md`.
2. Replace `const SPREADSHEET_ID = 'SHEET-ID-HERE';` with the Spreadsheet ID you copied earlier.

## 3) Manual initialization (optional but recommended)

- Run the `initializeSheets()` function from the Apps Script editor (select function, then click ▶ Run). This creates all schema sheets with headers so you can inspect them.

> When you run the first time, Apps Script will ask for authorization. Accept the prompts (the script needs permission to read/write the spreadsheet).
