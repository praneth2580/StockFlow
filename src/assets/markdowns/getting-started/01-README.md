## What this is

A lightweight **REST-like API** built with Google Apps Script that uses a single Google Spreadsheet as a multi-table database. Each table/entity (Products, Sales, Purchases, Suppliers, Settings) lives in its own sheet (tab). The API supports automatic sheet creation, CRUD operations, auto timestamps, and simple filters.
